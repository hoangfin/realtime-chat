# Realtime Chat
An ultimate full-stack project built with a **Modular Monolith** architecture, utilizing:
- **React/TypeScript** | **Material UI** for the front end.
- **Kafka** | **Redis** | **PostgreSQL** for backend services.

It delivers low-latency messaging, real-time presence tracking, and a responsive user interface.
Designed to handle millions of users, it showcases my expertise in full-stack development and modern system design.

## ðŸŽ‰ Core Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**
   - **Kafka**: Acts as the message broker for high-throughput, low-latency message delivery.
   - **Redis**: Caches recent messages for fast retrieval by connected users.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Stores metadata about messages (e.g., sender, timestamp) for structured querying.

- **Message Persistence**
   - **Kafka**: Persists messages in a durable log for long-term storage and replayability.
   - **Redis**: Stores recent messages in memory for quick access.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Maintains a structured history of messages for auditing and analytics.

- **Scalability**
   - **Kafka**: Scales horizontally to handle millions of messages per second.
   - **Redis**: Reduces database load by caching frequently accessed data.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Scales vertically and supports partitioning for large datasets.

- **Message Ordering**
   - **Kafka**: Guarantees message order within partitions for consistent delivery.
   - **Redis**: Maintains the sequence of messages in chat rooms using sorted sets.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Stores message metadata to ensure consistency in message ordering.

- **File Transfer**
    - **Kafka**: Handles metadata and events for file uploads and downloads.
    - **Redis**: Caches file metadata and temporary upload links for fast access.
    - **PostgreSQL**: Stores file metadata, access permissions, and download history.

- **User Authentication**
    - **Kafka**: Streams authentication events (e.g., login/logout) for real-time updates.
    - **Redis**: Stores session tokens and temporary authentication data for low-latency access.
    - **PostgreSQL**: Manages user credentials, roles, and permissions securely.

- **Presence & Online Status**
   - **Kafka**: Streams presence updates (e.g., online/offline) in real-time.
   - **Redis**: Tracks user presence with low-latency in-memory storage.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Stores historical presence data for analytics and reporting.

- **Push Notifications**
   - **Kafka**: Triggers notifications for offline users when new messages arrive.
   - **Redis**: Stores user notification preferences and device tokens for quick access.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Manages notification settings and delivery logs.

- **Message Acknowledgment**
   - **Kafka**: Tracks message delivery and consumption status.
   - **Redis**: Stores read receipts and acknowledgment status for real-time updates.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Logs acknowledgment history for auditing and analytics.

- **Group Chats & Channels**
   - **Kafka**: Uses topics to represent group chats and broadcast messages to members.
   - **Redis**: Stores metadata about group members, roles, and permissions.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Manages group memberships and permissions in a structured way.

- **Message Search**
   - **Kafka**: Indexes messages for advanced search capabilities (e.g., via Elasticsearch).
   - **Redis**: Caches frequently searched messages or metadata for faster retrieval.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Enables structured querying of message metadata (e.g., by sender or timestamp).

- **Rate Limiting**
    - **Kafka**: Decouples rate-limiting logic from the chat service for scalability.
    - **Redis**: Implements rate limiting using counters and time-windowed data structures.
    - **PostgreSQL**: Stores rate-limiting rules and historical data for analysis.

**ðŸ’ª Key Strengths Demonstrated:**
- **Kafka**: Scalable, real-time event streaming and message brokering.
- **Redis**: Low-latency caching, real-time presence tracking, and session management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Structured data storage, ACID compliance, and advanced querying.

## Backend Design

### Modular Monolith Architecture
A Modular Monolith is a software architecture that structures the application as a single deployment unit
(like a traditional monolith) but organizes its internal components or modules in such a way that they are
loosely coupled and highly cohesive. Each module within the architecture focuses on a specific business
domain or functionality, similar to how microservices operate, but without the distributed system complexity.
This modular design enables seamless extraction of individual module into an independent (micro)service
in the future, should the need arise for greater scalability or distribution.


### Why Monolith First

| Aspect                | Modular Monolith                                 | Microservices                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Simplicity            | Single codebase, easy to set up.                 | Complex setup with multiple services.           |
| Cost-Effectiveness    | Lower costs; fewer resources needed.             | Higher costs due to infrastructure needs.       |
| Flexibility           | Easily adaptable to changing requirements.       | Harder to adapt due to strict service boundaries.|
| Complexity            | Avoids network and distributed system challenges.| Challenges with network latency and consistency. |
| Domain Understanding  | Enables gradual discovery of boundaries.         | Requires upfront understanding of boundaries.   |
| Scalability           | Simple vertical scaling, but with limitations.   | Optimized for horizontal scaling.               |
| Team Collaboration    | Easier for small teams to collaborate.           | Promotes team autonomy with service ownership.  |
| Deployment            | Single deployment pipeline for the whole app.    | Independent pipelines for each service.         |

1. Architecture Overview
Monolithic Backend (Modular)
Use Node.js (main backend) â€” designed as a modular monolith with clean separation between bounded contexts (e.g., Messaging, Users, Presence).
Use Node.js for WebSocket gateway (real-time communication), forwarding messages to Node.js backend via Kafka or REST.
PostgreSQL for persistent data (users, messages).
Redis for caching and presence tracking (e.g., whoâ€™s online).
Kafka for event streaming (e.g., message delivery events, typing indicators).
Docker + Kubernetes for deployment.
2. Modules (Bounded Contexts) â€“ DDD Focus
a. User Module
Register/Login, Profile management
Auth (JWT or session)
Data: users table
b. Chat Module
Chat rooms (private & group), send/receive messages
Message storage, delivery tracking
Data: messages, chat_rooms, participants
c. Presence Module
Online/offline status, typing indicators
Use Redis pub/sub or keys with expiry
d. Notification Module
Real-time updates, push notifications
Consumes events from Kafka (e.g., message_sent, user_typing)
3. System Design Flow
Message Sending Example Flow:
Frontend: React client sends message via WebSocket to Node.js gateway.
Node.js:
Authenticates message (JWT).
Publishes to Kafka topic: chat.message_sent.
Node.js Backend (Modular Monolith):
Kafka consumer picks up event.
Validates & persists to PostgreSQL.
Emits delivery confirmation via Kafka: chat.message_delivered.
Node.js:
Subscribed to chat.message_delivered, forwards it via WebSocket to clients.
4. Tech Stack Roles
